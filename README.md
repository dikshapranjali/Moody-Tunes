## Inspiration
Human beings are emotional creatures whose state of mind can usually be observed through their facial expressions. In today's world where everyone is striving for achievement, many people are succumbing to loneliness and anxiety as a result of this struggle.**Moody Tunes** is a quick fix for people to elevate their moods by recommending movies and songs based on their feelings.
## What it does
Here's how the application works:
1. It recognizes facial expression based on the 6 categories i.e., angry, sad, fear, happy, surprise and neutral.
2. Based on the emotion it gives user two choices  either suggesting movies or songs.
3. If user wishes to watch movies/songs then a list of movies/songs matching their mood are suggested with movie/songs poster.
4. When user clicks on movie which he wishes to watch, they will be redirected to IMDB website and for songs it redirects them to Spotify website.
